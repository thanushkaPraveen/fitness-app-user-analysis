# Case Study: User Behavior Analysis for a Fitness Application


## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive case study analyzing user data from a fictional fitness tracking application. The analysis involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling (regression and classification), user segmentation (clustering), and a detailed discussion of the ethical and cultural implications of using personal data in software engineering.

The primary goal is to translate data-driven insights into an actionable roadmap for improving the application's user engagement and personalizing its features responsibly.

## Repository Structure

- **/data:** Contains the raw dataset (`fitness_app_user_dataset.csv`).
- **/notebook:** Contains the main Jupyter Notebook (`code.ipynb`) with all the data analysis and model training steps.
- **/dashboard:** Contains the Python script for the interactive Streamlit dashboard (`dashboard.py`).
- **/presentation:** Contains the final presentation slides in PDF format.
